Creating a Google Sheet product catalog for Suruli Greens...

1. Go to https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/
2. Create a new spreadsheet
3. Add the following columns (make sure to include all 7 columns in this exact order):
   - Column A: Product ID
   - Column B: Product Name
   - Column C: Product Category
   - Column D: Description
   - Column E: Price
   - Column F: Availability
   - Column G: Image URL (optional - will use auto-generated images if empty)

4. Structure your data with the following guidelines:
   - Group products by their categories
   - Each product should have a unique ID
   - Make sure each product has a category assigned
   - Set availability as either "In Stock" or "Out of Stock"
   - For Image URL, you can paste links to images (e.g., from Unsplash, Google Drive, etc.)

5. When the spreadsheet is ready:
   - Make it public (Share > Anyone with the link can view)
   - Copy the spreadsheet ID from the URL
   - Update the SHEET_ID in the products.js file

This will allow your customers to browse products by category and see individual items when they click on a category.

Note: Updates to the Google Sheet will be reflected on your website after a short delay.
