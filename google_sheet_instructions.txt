Creating a Google Sheet product catalog for Suruli Greens...

1. Go to https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/
2. Create a new spreadsheet
3. Add the following columns:
   - Product ID
   - Product Name
   - Product Category
   - Description
   - Price
   - Availability
   - Image URL (optional - will use auto-generated images if empty)

4. Structure your data with the following guidelines:
   - Group products by their categories
   - Each product should have a unique ID
   - Make sure each product has a category assigned
   - Set availability as either "In Stock" or "Out of Stock"

5. When the spreadsheet is ready:
   - Make it public (Share > Anyone with the link can view)
   - Copy the spreadsheet ID from the URL
   - Update the SHEET_ID in the products.js file

This will allow your customers to browse products by category and see individual items when they click on a category.

Note: Updates to the Google Sheet will be reflected on your website after a short delay.
